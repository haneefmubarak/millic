Commands
========

Usually just expansions, although selective commands are actually macros of a sort. Until dynamic matching and dynamically allocated tables and all the other cool stuff is implemented, any commands will have to be hardcoded into the primary parsing functions.

Features
========
Some of the cool ones:

 - Less syntax
 - Improved wording
 - Statements are shorter
 - If you include a header, its library will automatically be linked when possible
 - If you include a library, all necessary headers will be included, and the library will be automatically linked when possible
 - Use of pointers (Referencing and Dereferencing) is automatic when possible, although you may still manually specify
 - Operator overloading is allowed with Arithmetic and Binary operations; Prioritization is as follows: `Bitwise (not, and, or, shift, etc.)` > `Arithmetic (BEDMAS, modulo (equal to mul/div), etc.)` > `Comparison (==, !=, >, <=, etc.)` > `Logical (not, and, or, xor, etc.)`
 - Extended logical and bitwise operators; new operators: bitwise (~&, ~|, ~^) and logical (!&&, !||, ^^, !^^)
 

Roadmap
=======

- [ ] libc
	- [ ] stdio
	- [ ] stdlib
	- [ ] assert
	- [ ] time

That's really all that I need at the moment, if you need anything yourself, implement it, or better still, help create an additional parser that will allow me to include additional `command-lists` of sorts.
